# IOOS Code Sprint
This repo is used to organize the approx biannual IOOS Code Sprint.  

The IOOS Code Sprint is a 4-day hackathon style event organized by NOAAâ€™s Integrated Ocean Observing System Office. Over the course of the event, teams of developers, academic researchers, and community members will work on projects that address pressing data and information challenges. Projects will relate to the IOOS mission to produce, integrate, and communicate high quality ocean, coastal and Great Lakes information that meets the safety, economic, and stewardship needs of the Nation.

## 2022
We're pleased to announce that IOOS plans to host the 2022 DMAC Code Sprint in Chicago with our partner GLOS!

Save the dates of April 25 - 28, 2022 for the second DMAC community code sprint.  We're planning to host an in person event in Chicago, with the option for virtual participation for those who are unable to travel to be there in person. 

We'll be reaching out in the near future with more details about meeting logistics, sprint/activity planning, technologies we hope to use for the virtual component of the sprint, and all the rest.

If you have any suggestions or input about the sprint, please post them in the #dmac channel in the IOOS Slack - https://ioos.slack.com. As we did two years ago, we expect to use Slack heavily during the sprint.   

See the proposed track list [here](https://github.com/ioos/ioos-code-sprint/blob/main/2022/track-list.md).
