For each topic, we recommend that the lead submits a Code Sprint Project Proposal to the [ioos-code-sprint repository]({{ site.github.repository_url }}), identifying the scope of that topic. 
This will help ensure each code sprint topic has a plan that can be executed during the code sprint week.

Expectations for topic leads: Leads are expected to identify a plan for the code sprint topic, establish a team, and take the lead on executing said plan.

To submit topics of interest use the GitHub issue form below.
