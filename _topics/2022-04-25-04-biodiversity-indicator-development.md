Open source biodiversity indicator development from open data.
Initial ideas for this topic found [here]( https://github.com/marinebon/obis2index/blob/master/2022-ioos-code-sprint/topic_plan.md)

Team
* Tylar Murray, USF-IMaRS, MBON
* Ben Best, EcoQuants
* Sonja Giardina, PacIOOS
* Hassan Moustahfid, IOOS
* Abby Benson, USGS, OBIS-USA

The group identified several avenues for investigation:
* Analyzing ES50 globally at decade time steps on a subset small enough for GitHub actions [vignette](need link)
* Detecting Range Shifts for an Individual Taxa using OBIS data
* MPAs ES50 using OBIS data

A huge amount of work went into developing the R package [obisindicators](https://marinebon.org/obisindicators/) by Ben Best to provide us a great foundation to work from and build on.

If you're interested to get involved please see the issues we have here [obis2index github issues tracker](https://github.com/marinebon/obis2index/issues) and add issues yourself.

Future directions
* Continue to meet and further development of the R package and vignette
* Consider continuing this work at OceanHackWeek 2022
