Subject: IOOS Code Sprint – registration confirmation, Slack, participant guide

Dear IOOS Code Sprinters,

Thank you for confirming your attendance at the upcoming [**IOOS Code Sprint**](https://ioos.github.io/ioos-code-sprint/). We’re looking forward to working with
you!

This email contains some actions required for your participation in the
Code Sprint, including an invite to our Slack.

Actions required:

1. Add yourself to our Slack with this **[invite link]**
   * Say hello in the `#code-sprint-2022` channel – we would encourage you to communicate
     and share background information prior to the event
   * Join the channel(s) for your topic(s) - You will see channels already exist in the 
     OceanObservationData Slack space. To facilitate collaboration beyond the Code Sprint, 
     we recommend that you join the channels that are appropriate for the 
     projects you would like to work on. For example, if you would like to work on projects 
     related to ERDDAP, join the `#erddap` channel. If a channel does not already exist
     we can work with you to create a new one.

2. Look at the [Participant guide]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link resources/participant-guide.md %})
   which is a summary of the key points covered during the briefing presentation
   * We also recommend you look at the [other resources and tutorial notebooks]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link resources.md %})

If you have any questions or issues, you can use the `#code-sprint-2022` channel on Slack.

For Topic Leads:
Topic leads will have the flexibility to use the collaboration software of their choosing. Leads need 
to communicate to potential contributors as how they intend to facilitate collaboration. The default services
we will be providing during the Code Sprint include: 

* Slack
* Google Hangouts

Every Friday from 2:00-2:45pm ET there is a Code Sprint Check-In meeting. If you have any questions or would like to partake in the planning process, please feel free to join.

**[insert Google Hangouts connection information]**


See you at **13:00 (CST) on 25th April!**

Best regards,

IOOS Code Sprint Planning Committee
