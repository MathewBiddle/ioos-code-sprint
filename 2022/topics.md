See the track list started [here](https://github.com/ioos/ioos-code-sprint/blob/main/2022/track-list.md).

For each topic, we recommend that the lead submits an [issue](https://github.com/ioos/ioos-code-sprint/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=code-sprint-project-proposal.md&title=Project+title) to the [ioos-code-sprint repository]({{ site.github.repository_url }}), identifying the scope of that topic. This will help ensure each code sprint topic has a plan that can be executed during the code sprint week.

Expectations for topic leads: Leads are expected to identify a plan for the code sprint topic, establish a team, and take the lead on executing said plan.
