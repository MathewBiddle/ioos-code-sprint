Add yourself to the OceanObservationData Slack with this [link](https://join.slack.com/t/ioos/shared_invite/zt-16fcb3lev-SsqZQkXC~Z23KbTvosUaNg).

## Channels

Say hello in the `#code-sprint-2022` channel – we would encourage you to communicate and share background information prior to the event. 

Join the channel(s) for your topic(s) - By selecting “Add channels,” you will see channels already exist in the OceanObservationData Slack space. To facilitate collaboration beyond the Code Sprint, we recommend that you join the channels that are appropriate for the projects you would like to work on. 

For example, if you would like to work on projects related to ERDDAP, join the `#erddap` channel. If a channel does not already exist we can work with you to create a new one.

## Pinned posts

We highly recommend creating a post in the relevant channels that include some useful links. Slack has a nice feature to [pin posts](https://slack.com/help/articles/205239997-Pin-messages-and-bookmark-links) so that they are easily accessible later. Below is an example of what a post might look like, which you can pin to the channel. This will help folks know where to get pertinent information to your Code Sprint topic.
